## Abstract

##### Human motion similarity is practiced in many fields, including action recognition, anomaly detection, and human performance evaluation. While many computer vision tasks have benefited from deep learning, motion similarity has attracted less attention, particularly due to the lack of large datasets. In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach that creates motion embeddings suitable for measuring the similarity between different motions of each human body part. The network is trained with a proposed motion variation loss to robustly differentiate even similar motions. Furthermore, we introduce two datasets: synthetic motion dataset for model training and human annotations of the real-world video data pairs from NTU RGB+D 120 for motion similarity evaluation.
