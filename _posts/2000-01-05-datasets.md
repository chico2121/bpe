## Datasets
We created two datasets for learning and evaluating motion similarity.

1. For model training, a motion sequence was generated using the [Adobe Mixamo](www.mixamo.com) framework. ([dataset link](https://github.com/chico2121/SARA_Dataset))
<br/><br/>
2. For model evaluation, similarity annotations between motion video pairs of [NTU RGB+D 120](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04757) were collected. ([dataset link](https://github.com/SukhyunCho/NTU_motion_sim_annotations))
